# **Cypress Automation Project**

This project leverages **Cypress**, a powerful JavaScript-based end-to-end testing tool, to automate the testing of critical features, including:  

- **User login**  
- **User information update**  

Cypress provides a simplified approach to writing, running, and debugging tests directly in a real browser, ensuring reliability and ease of use.

## **Prerequisites**

Before getting started, make sure the following items are installed and configured in your environment:  

1. **Node.js** (minimum recommended version: 14.x)  
2. **npm package manager** (included with Node.js)  

To verify the installation:  
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

---

## **Installation**

Clone the repository and install the project dependencies:  
```bash
git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
cd <PROJECT_NAME>
npm install
```

## **Available Scripts**

You can use the following scripts to work with the project:  

### **Open Cypress UI (Interactive Mode)**  
This command launches the Cypress Test Runner, allowing you to execute tests and view results in real time within the browser:  
```bash
npx cypress open
```  

### **Run Tests via Command Line**  
To run tests directly from the terminal, use:  
```bash
npx cypress run
```  

Optionally, specify a test file or suite:  
```bash
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/login.spec.js"
```

## **Test Description**

### **1. Login Tests**  
- Validation of required fields (email and password).  
- Verification of behavior with invalid credentials.  
- Successful login with valid credentials.  

### **2. User Update Tests**  
- Updating profile information.  
- Validation of required fields.  
- Confirmation of error messages for invalid inputs.

## **Test Results**

- All tests are executed with detailed reports on success and failure.  
- Cypress generates screenshots and videos for easier debugging, located in the `cypress/screenshots` and `cypress/videos` folders.

## **Tips and Best Practices**

- Use the command `npx cypress verify` to ensure Cypress is correctly installed.  
- Keep your tests organized and prioritize using mock data to avoid dependency on external APIs.
